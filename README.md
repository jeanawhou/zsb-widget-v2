# ZSB widget version 2

This project is built with Vite and React.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have Node.js 18 installed on your machine. We recommend using NVM (Node Version Manager) for managing Node.js versions.

### Installing Node.js 18 with NVM

If you don't have NVM installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [NVM GitHub repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Once NVM is installed, you can install Node.js 18 by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
nvm install 18
```

To switch to Node.js 18 for this project, use the following command:

```bash
nvm use 18
```

This ensures that you are using Node.js 18 for this specific project.
